# Ubiquitous Umbrella
During my research work I had hard times to find how to generate uniform distribution of random coordinates of points in
and on simple and complex forms. 

With this project I want to provide a Python Package to easily create uniform distribution in lot of geometrical forms
and the mathematical background to understand everything.
